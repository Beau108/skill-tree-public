# 🌳 Skill Tree

A full-stack **Spring Boot + React** application that gamifies skill development through visual, shareable progress trees.

**Skill Tree** is a full-stack web application that helps users **track, visualize, and share their personal skill development**. It organizes abilities into hierarchical “trees” with measurable progress, achievements, and time spent — creating a gamified approach to learning and growth.

## 📆 Project Status: “Final Backend Prototype”
*Updated: 11/13/25*

This repository represents the **final iteration of the Skill Tree backend**, capturing the complete architecture, endpoints, and data models that power the platform. It is **feature-complete** but **not yet fully tested or production-deployed**, basic CRUD operations have been verified for all controllers. The project serves as a strong foundation for user management, skill tracking, achievements, and activity logging through a RESTful **Spring Boot API** integrated with **MongoDB** and **Firebase Authentication**.

This is not the repository I use for devlopment.

## 🧭 Next Steps
- 🧩 **Frontend Integration** — refine the React client for smoother user experience and API consumption  
- ✅ **E2E Testing** — implement end-to-end scripts to validate full-stack functionality  
- 🌐 **Cloud Deployment** — deploy API and image storage on **AWS**, with authentication and hosting managed via **Firebase**  
- 🔁 **Iteration & Feedback** — gather user input and explore new features to enhance usability and engagement
